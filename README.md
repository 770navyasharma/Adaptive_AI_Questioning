### Adaptive AI Questioning

## Description
Our model, named 'Adaptive AI Questioning', revolutionizes personalized education by dynamically tailoring learning experiences to individual student abilities. By intelligently adjusting question difficulty and learning pace, it maximizes student engagement and comprehension. It empowers educators to deliver targeted instruction, identify learning gaps, and drive better learning outcomes. With our model, every student receives a customized learning journey, ensuring no one gets left behind.
We have implemented an RL model(Reinforcement learning model) all by ourselves for implementing the adaptive testing framework and data is updated at runtime for better adaptation.
